This ensures that every commit has a distinct ID, making it easy to track and reference specific changes in your repository.\n\nYou can use the commit ID to:\n\n* Identify a specific commit in your repository's history\n* Reference a commit in commands, such as `git log` or `git checkout`\n* Create a new branch or tag based on a specific commit\n\nFor example, a commit ID might look like this: `4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904`."

You can see the commit hash in the output of commands like `git log` or `git show`."

For example, to squash `feature/login` into `main`:\n`git checkout main`\n`git merge --squash feature/login`\n`git commit -m \"Squashed login feature\"`\n\n2. **`git rebase -i`** lets you rewrite commits interactively, including squashing. For instance, to squash the last 3 commits on your current branch:\n`git rebase -i HEAD~3`\nThen mark commits with \"squash\" in the interactive editor.\n\nKey difference: `merge --squash` discards the source branch's history, while `rebase` rewrites it. Use `merge --squash` for one-time integration, `rebase` for cleaner linear history before pushing."

This creates a simple diff patch.\n\nKey differences:\n- `git format-patch` includes commit metadata and handles binaries, ideal for sharing commits via email. Example: `git format-patch HEAD~1`\n- `git diff` produces basic diffs without metadata. Both patches work with `git apply`, but only `git am` preserves metadata from `format-patch` output."

TFVC requires constant server connectivity.\n- **CLI/GUI**: VS 2013’s Git GUI handles basics (commit, branch, merge), but advanced features like `git rebase` or `git commit --amend` may need CLI.\n- **Start Guides**: Microsoft’s [Use Visual Studio with Git](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/azure/devops/repos/git/share-your-code-in-git-vs-2013) and [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) are excellent resources.
