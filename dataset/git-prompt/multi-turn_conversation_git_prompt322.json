This ensures that every commit has a distinct ID, making it easy to track and reference specific changes in your repository.\n\nYou can use the commit ID to:\n\n* Identify a specific commit in your repository's history\n* Reference a commit in commands, such as `git log` or `git checkout`\n* Create a new branch or tag based on a specific commit\n\nFor example, a commit ID might look like this: `4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904`."

You can see the commit hash in the output of commands like `git log` or `git show`."
